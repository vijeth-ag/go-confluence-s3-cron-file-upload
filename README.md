Installing Artifactory in a multi-node configuration with RPM involves setting up multiple Artifactory nodes on separate servers to distribute the load and ensure high availability. This guide assumes you have access to the necessary servers and permissions to install and configure Artifactory. Here are the steps to achieve a multi-node Artifactory installation using RPM:

**Preparation:**
1. Obtain the Artifactory RPM package from the official JFrog website or the repository URL provided by JFrog.

**Installation:**
1. Install Artifactory on each node:
   - Transfer the RPM package to each server where you want to install Artifactory.
   - Install the RPM package using the following command:
     ```bash
     sudo yum install /path/to/artifactory.rpm
     ```

2. Configuration:
   - After installation, each node will have its own Artifactory instance running. By default, they will use an embedded Derby database. For multi-node setup, you'll need to configure them to use an external database like PostgreSQL or MySQL for data synchronization.

3. Set Up External Database:
   - Install and configure the chosen external database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.) on a separate server or a dedicated database server. Follow the database-specific installation and configuration instructions.

4. Node Configuration:
   - For each Artifactory node, modify the `${ARTIFACTORY_HOME}/etc/artifactory.system.properties` file to use the external database for data synchronization.
   - Restart Artifactory on each node for the configuration changes to take effect.

5. Artifactory HA (High Availability) Setup:
   - Choose one of the Artifactory nodes to be the primary (master) node, and set up the others as secondary nodes (slaves).
   - Configure Artifactory HA by following the official Artifactory High Availability documentation provided by JFrog. This involves configuring the primary node as the cluster coordinator and the secondary nodes to connect to the primary node.

6. Load Balancer Setup:
   - To distribute the load among Artifactory nodes, set up a load balancer (e.g., Nginx, Apache) in front of the Artifactory nodes.
   - The load balancer should distribute incoming requests across the Artifactory nodes, ensuring that each node receives a balanced share of the traffic.

7. Security Considerations:
   - Implement SSL/TLS certificates for secure communication with Artifactory.
   - Set up firewall rules and security groups to control access to the Artifactory nodes.

8. High Availability Testing:
   - Perform tests to ensure that the load is distributed correctly and that high availability is achieved.

Please note that setting up a multi-node Artifactory environment with high availability requires careful planning and consideration of network configurations, database setup, and load balancing. It's essential to refer to the official Artifactory documentation and best practices provided by JFrog for more detailed guidance on configuring Artifactory in a multi-node setup.
